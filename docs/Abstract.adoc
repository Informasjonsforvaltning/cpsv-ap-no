__This specification, CPSV-AP-NO, is the Norwegian application profile of https://semiceu.github.io/CPSV-AP/releases/3.2.0/[EUs CPSV-AP &#x29C9;, window="_blank", role="ext-link"]. It specifies how to describe services and events and how to make the descriptions available in machine-readable RDF-based formats.__ 

__The specification is mainly in Norwegian. However, in <<Spesifikasjon-per-klasse, Chap. 3>> which requires a certain level of knowledge in RDF, the specification of the classes and properties is in both Norwegian and English. Norwegian extensions (compared to CPSV-AP) are also documented as "Note" to the class/property in concern.__
